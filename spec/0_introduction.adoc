== Introduction

A GeoPackage <<geopackage>> is a platform-independent SQLite <<sqlite>> database file that contains GeoPackage data and metadata tables.
GeoPackage is designed to be extensible, including support for additional data types.

The OGC Web Services Context Document (OWS Context <<ows_context>>) was created to allow a set of configured information resources (service set) to be passed between applications as a collection of services and inline content.

This document defines a set of extensions that allows a GeoPackage to contain OWS Context documents in a relational encoding.
