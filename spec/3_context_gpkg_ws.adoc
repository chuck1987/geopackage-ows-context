==== OWS Context Web Services
It is possible to encode OGC Web Services in a GeoPackage-based OWS Context. The service type is determined by the `code` of `gpkgext_context_offerings`. The OWS Context Encoding Standard currently supports `WMS`, `WFS`, `WCS`, `WPS`, `CSW`, and `WMTS`. It is the responsibility of the GeoPackage producer to ensure that the recipient is able to handle the stored content appropriately. 

In general, the `gpkgext_context_operations` table is used to store the example requests (and if necessary, example responses) needed to describe the service interfaces. I will eventually cannibalize some information from the core to explain this further. Your mileage may vary.
